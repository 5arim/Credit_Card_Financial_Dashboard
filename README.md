The solution demonstrates proficiency in end-to-end data pipeline construction, advanced DAX modeling, and clear data storytelling.Project FocusMetrics CoveredKey Tools UsedFinancial PerformanceRevenue, Interest Earned, Transaction Volume, Delinquency Rate, Card Utilization.Power BI Desktop, DAX, SQL (Postgres/MySQL), CSV.Customer SegmentationIncome Group, Age Group, Marital Status, Education Level, Card Type.Data Modeling (Star Schema), ETL/Power Query.Business ValueOptimized weekly reporting cycle, informed marketing strategies, and risk assessment.GitHub, Documentation (This README).🎯 Business Problem & Project ObjectivesThe primary objective was to streamline the weekly financial reporting process and move away from static reports by providing stakeholders with real-time, interactive insights into the credit card portfolio's health and customer behavior.Key Objectives:Establish a Robust Data Pipeline (ETL): Connect Power BI directly to a structured SQL environment to handle future data scaling and simplify the weekly data refresh cycle.Develop Advanced Financial Metrics: Implement complex DAX logic to track critical measures like Week-over-Week (WoW) Revenue Change and the Delinquency Rate.Drive Customer Strategy: Segment customers by demographics and behavioral data to identify high-value groups and assess risk profiles.💻 Technical Implementation & Skills Demonstrated1. Data Architecture & ETLData Source Integration: Successfully ingested raw transaction and customer data from CSV files into an SQL database (e.g., using Postgres SQL) to establish a clean, queryable source environment.Power Query (M Language): Used for initial data cleansing, type transformation, and defining the data relationships before loading into the Power BI Data Model.2. Advanced Data Modeling & DAXStar Schema Design: Structured the data model with distinct fact (Transaction details) and dimension tables (Customer demographics, Date Table) to optimize query performance and ensure accurate aggregation.Time Intelligence (WoW): Created a custom measure using CALCULATE, FILTER, and ALL functions to calculate the percentage change in revenue and transactions between the current week and the previous week—a critical financial KPI.Segmentation Logic: Implemented DAX SWITCH(TRUE(), ...) functions to categorize customer data into digestible groups:Age Group: (e.g., 20-30, 30-40, 60+)Income Group: (Low, Medium, High)3. Visualization and Report StructureThe final solution is organized into two primary, interconnected reports:Report NameFocusCore Insights Provided1. Credit Card Transaction ReportFinancial Health & TrendsRevenue Trend: Weekly performance visualization. Spend Analysis: Breakdown of revenue by Card Type (Blue vs. Platinum) and Transaction Type (Swipe vs. Online).2. Credit Card Customer ReportPortfolio Quality & RiskRisk Assessment: Delinquency rate segmented by job title and marital status. Customer Value: Contribution to total revenue by Income and Age Group.📈 Key Business Insights & Value DeliveredThe dashboard provides immediate answers to critical business questions, enabling data-driven decision-making:Performance Monitoring: The WoW Revenue Change table immediately alerts users to significant performance shifts, allowing for prompt investigation into spikes or dips.Risk Identification: Pinpointed that the Self-Employed customer job group exhibited the highest rate of delinquent accounts, guiding the Risk team to refine underwriting criteria for this segment.Marketing Optimization: Confirmed that the 40-60 Age Group and High-Income Group are the primary revenue drivers, recommending targeted campaigns to maximize return on investment (ROI).Product Strategy: Identified that Blue and Silver Cards contribute over 90% of the overall transaction volume, justifying a focus on the retention and upgrade path for these tiers.🚀 Getting StartedTo view and interact with the live report:Prerequisite: Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed.Clone the Repository: Download the project files.Open: Open the .pbix file. The data will load automatically from the saved connection.Explore: Use the various slicers (Date, Income Group, Card Type) to drill down into the data and replicate the insights mentioned above.📸 Dashboard Screenshots (Placeholder)*(Recruiter Note: Please insert 2-3 high-resolution images here showing the main summary views of your dashboard.
